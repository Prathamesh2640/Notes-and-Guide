c) return
d) exit
Answer: b) break

What will be the output of the following code snippet?

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}

a) next()
b) nextInt()
c) nextLine()
d) nextDouble()
Answer: b) nextInt()

What will be the output of the following code snippet if the user inputs "John"?

java
Copy code
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
String name = input.next();
System.out.println("Your name is " + name);
input.close();
a) Enter your name: John Your name is John
b) Enter your name: John
Your name is John
c) Your name is John
d) Compilation Error
Answer: b) Enter your name: John
Your name is John

Explanation of Concepts:
Data Types: Java has both primitive (e.g., int, char, boolean) and reference types (e.g., String, arrays).
Wrapper Classes: These classes wrap primitive data types into objects (e.g., Integer for int).
Widening and Narrowing: Widening converts a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., int to double), while narrowing converts a larger data type to a smaller one (e.g., double to int).
Boxing and Unboxing: Boxing is the conversion of a primitive type to a corresponding wrapper class object, while unboxing is the reverse process.
Control Statements: These include if, switch, loops (for, while, do-while), and jump statements (break, continue).
Scanner Class: This class is used to read input from various sources, including user input from the console.
These questions and explanations should help in understanding and applying the fundamental concepts of Java programming covered in the document.
