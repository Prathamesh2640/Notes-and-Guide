Code Snippet 1:
java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.add("Orange");
        
        for (String fruit : list) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
This code snippet demonstrates the usage of ArrayList (a resizable array implementation of List) to store and iterate over a list of fruits.

Code Snippet 2:
java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(10);
        set.add(20);
        set.add(30);
        
        System.out.println("Set size: " + set.size());
    }
}
Explanation:
This code snippet shows the usage of HashSet (an unordered Set implementation) to store integers and prints the size of the set.
